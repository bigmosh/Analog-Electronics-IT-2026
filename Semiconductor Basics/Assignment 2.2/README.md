# DC Sweep Simulation – 1N4148 Diode

## Name(s)
Sanni Moshood Abiola

## Sweep Range and Step
The DC analysis sweeps the voltage source **V1** from **0 V to 15 V** with a **step size of 1 V**.

## Plot Description
The plot shows the **forward current through the 1N4148 diode increasing approximately linearly with the swept input voltage**, because the diode maintains an almost constant forward voltage while the 1 kΩ resistor limits the current.
